# Registration of Tickets

Registration of Tickets is one of my academic projects, in which you can submit tickets based on the car's license plate and the owner's ID and keep track of the tickets.<br>
This project is written in C++ and includes working with files to keep track of the history of the tickets.<br>
This project was written in 2018 and developed in C++.
